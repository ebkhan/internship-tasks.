Task 2: Credit Risk Prediction
Objective:
Predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default on a loan.
1)Import pandas library for (data manipulation and analysis)
  Import matplotlib and seaborn for (data visualizations).
  from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split (used for training model)
  from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression (used for training model)
  from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier (used for training model)
  from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, classification_report (used for training model)
  from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder (used for training model)
  from sklearn.metrics import ConfusionMatrixDisplay (used for confusion matrix)

2)loading data set of Loan Prediction

3)Handle Missing Data

3.1)Missing values are common in this dataset (e.g., 'Gender', 'Married', 'Dependents', 'Self_Employed', 'Credit_History')
3.2)Rename column name of ApplicantIncome to Income

4)Visualize Key Features such as loan amount, education, and income.
5)I have choosen Logistic Regression model for model training because of its interpretability, stability, and regulatory acceptability, as it clearly explains how each feature affects the default probability 
6)Encoding categorical variables converts non-numeric labels into numerical values necessary for machine learning models
7)Model Training & Evaluation
8) Confusion matrix
